Create 8 base models named `Base1`..`Base8` under the `Bases` folder.
Each base should include:
- `SpawnLocation` (SpawnLocation) for respawn.
- `PurchaseSpot` (Part) used as default anchor for display positions.
- `DisplaySlots` (Folder) with numbered `Slot1`.. parts (optional; fallback grid used otherwise).
- `OwnerBillboard` (BillboardGui) with a TextLabel to show owner name.
- Optional `Purchases` (Folder) where cloned purchases will parent.

Mark TODO: adjust positions, walls, textures.
